	Being that bass are so aggressive they don't have to be hungry to be able to catch them. They just need to be active. Some of the best bass fishing rigs and baits fall under the finesse fishing category. The key to finesse fishing is finding fish and put the bait right in front of the fish. The action on these baits will aggravate these fish so much that even if they aren't hungry they will still strike out of pure aggression.Some of the most popular finesse rigs are drop shot and wacky rigs and some popular baits are stick baits, Senkos and trick worms.

	Bass fishing is something that is easy to pick up and can be enjoyable for the whole family.
